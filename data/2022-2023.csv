Software Engineering,"Educational institute Graduate School of Informatics Programme type Master's Credits 60 EC Duration 1 year Instruction language English Education form Full-time, Day-time class Contact Education Desk FNWI Science Park 904 020 5257100 TheMaster Software Engineeringis a one-year academic programme with a compulsory curriculum of 60 EC. It familiarises students with the broad and dynamic field of software engineering. Software engineering projects are complex undertakings, and there is no single recipe that guarantees success in all cases. This one year master's programme makes students better software engineers, designers and architects. It enables graduates to make significant contributions to large-scale software projects in industry and academia alike. Software engineering uses many results from computer science, but the Master programme Software Engineering distinguishes itself from classical computer science curricula in a number of aspects, among others the size and complexity of software systems concerned and the role of human factors in the software engineering process. Both aspects lead to a high degree of uncertainty about the impact and validity of design decisions. What is good for performance may be detrimental for understandability, maintainability and re-use. Software engineers must strive to understand these trade-offs and reduce dependencies. As changing and conflicting goals are omnipresent, software continuously needs to evolve. The software engineering domain in itself is in constant flux. Innovations in technology, design patterns and techniques are continuous. Out-of-the-box solutions often have their specific limitations. We believe a good software engineer is like a good researcher. We teach our students how to acquire relevant knowledge, how to improve making decisions, how to reflect on their current approaches and ideas and to continuously question their assumptions. We expect students to have a solid technological basis and a fundamental understanding of computer science and software. From a technical perspective the curriculum covers software quality, specification-based testing and verification, code analysis and transformation as well as code evolution according to software metrics. These cross-cutting issues are complemented with domain-specific software concerns from new and emerging domains, such as cloud-based software and cyber-physical systems. Non-technical topics focus on requirements engineering and on organizational aspects of the software engineering process. Continuous interaction between students and staff is characteristic for the programme. Students work on challenging assignments and receive immediate feedback.

Programme,"Website:http://www.student.uva.nl/se Programme Director:dr. A.M. (Ana) Oprescu Programme coordinator:mr. drs. N. (Nienke) Boevé-Spil Study adviser:M. (Mailis) Birsak MScm.birsak2@uva.nl Programme organisation:The programme takes one academic year (60 credits) to complete and awards a Master of Science degree in Software Engineering. We offer 1-year full-time and 2-year part-time options. Study load and credits:The University of Amsterdam (UvA) applies the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS). The general study load for students is 30 EC per semester. A full academic year of two semesters equals 60 EC. Each semester lasts 20 weeks with 3 periods: 2 periods of 8 weeks and a third period of 4 weeks. A student’s study load (both contact hours and hours spent studying and preparing for assignments) is measured in European Credits (EC). According to Dutch law 1 EC represents 28 hours of work and 60 EC represent one academic year of full-time study. This is equivalent to about 40 hours of work per week. Regular courses: Period 1: Period 2: Period 4: Preparation Master Project: This special course throughout periods 1, 2 and 3 complements the regular courses in teaching general academic and research skills with a focus on software engineering skills and background literature. In period 3 students prepare a research proposal that sets the scene for their graduation project. Master Project Software Engineering: The 18-EC graduation project spans periods 5 and 6. During this graduation project students demonstrate the skills they have obtained so far. Graduation projects can be done in industry, at other research institutions or embedded within research groups at the University of Amsterdam. The graduation project leads to a written thesis to be orally defended in front of a committee.

Part-time programme,"In the part-time variant one course is taken per period instead of two. Students are expected to work appoximately 20 hours per week and to spend two full days per week on campus, either Monday/Tuesday or Wednesday/Thursday. Presence is required to attend lectures, workshops and labs, but likewise to do group work with other students. We do not prescribe any particular order of courses, and students can adapt their schedule to external needs and requirements."

Supplementary lectures will go into truth finding, sense making, best practices, methods and will provide an abstract model for RE. At the heart, RE is about knowledge elicitation, creation and validation. Making decisions about what system to construct. We humans are by no means truth telling and finding machines. You will explore psychological and philosophical sources to get a better understanding of how that works. To do proper requirements engineering requires a number of skills, during this course we will work to develop your skills in a small real life project. This first hand experience will enable you to better appreciate the intricacies in applying theory even in a simple domain.

Without a specification, it is impossible to state what a piece of software should do, and there is no reasonable way to set up the test process. An informal specification is not enough. If we aim to automate the test process we need pre-given information about: Programs written in functional or imperative languages can be tested, given a formal specification, by means of a random test generator. This test method will be illustrated for a number of example programs that are written in Haskell. The course assumes basic familiarity with this language and focusses on how to test programs written in either functional or imperative style, and how to use tools for automated test generation. Basic familiarity with logic and functional programming in Haskell.

Model-based Design of Cyber-physical Systems,"Course catalogue number 5364MBDC6Y Credits 6 EC Language of instruction English Time period(s)  See also College/graduate Graduate School of Informatics Lecturer(s) Contact Education Desk FNWIScience Park 904B1020 5257100servicedesk-esc-science@uva.nl servicedesk-esc-science@uva.nl Is part of Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are systems that integrate computation, sensing, actuation, and networking to interact with and control the physical world. They are built for a particular purpose and exist in many application domains. Well-known examples of CPS from different domains include satellites, airplanes, cars, cleaning robots, smart grids, smart lighting, x-ray machines, printers, radars, and lithography machines. The design of CPS is a multi-disciplinary activity that combines different fields, such as embedded systems, software engineering, control theory, and mechatronics, and is fundamentally different from the design of general-purpose computer systems, such as a desktop computer. CPS are subject to different non-functional requirements, such as size, weight, energy consumption, reliability, security, and cost. Some cyber-physical systems, such as a car or an airplane, are furthermore safety critical, and must guarantee that a system failure cannot result in death or injury. Such a system must always be available and must reliably produce correct results. To further complicate matters, the correctness of most CPS is not just defined by the correct result of a computation, but by the correct result and the correct timing. For example, consider an air-bag controller in a car, which must inflate the air-bag in time before the driver’s head hits the steering wheel, or a flight control system, which must correct turbulence before the airplane becomes unstable. Trends show that CPS across application domains are getting more and more complex. The consequences of this increasing complexity are visible in daily practice in which industry struggles to efficiently develop correct and well-performing CPS. This course is an introduction to CPS and their design, with a focus on computing aspects (hardware and software). It teaches how the increasing complexity of CPS can be addressed by model-based design methodologies in which abstraction, provided by models used for specification, analysis, simulation, or synthesis, play an essential role in increasing system quality and reducing development time and overall system cost.
