Content,"The Master Software Engineering has as goal to familiarize students with the broad and dynamic field of software engineering. Software engineering projects are complex and there is no recipe that guarantees success. This one year master makes students better engineers and designers, enabling them to make a significant contribution to large software projects and research projects addressing big software engineering questions. Software engineering uses many results from computer science but distinguishes itself from classical computer science curricula with respect to the role of human factors, system size and volatility of requirements. These factors cause a high degree of uncertainty about the impact and validity of design decisions. What is good for performance can be detrimental for understand ability. As software engineers and researchers we strive to understand these trade offs and reduce dependencies. As change and conflicting stakes are omnipresent, software continuously needs to evolve. The software engineering domain in itself is in constant flux. Innovations in technology, design patterns and techniques are continuous. However, out-of-the-box solutions often have their specific limitations. We believe a good software engineer is like a good researcher. We intend to teach our students how to acquire relevant knowledge, how to improve making decisions, how to reflect on their current approach, how to learn to question their assumptions and how to assess their ideas. We expect students to have a solid technological basis and a fundamental understanding of computer science and software. From a technical perspective the curriculum covers software quality, specification-based automated testing, automatic code analysis, automatic code transformation and development of domain specific languages. Non-technical topics focus on how to develop a software architecture, on understanding issues in requirements engineering and on organizational aspects of software engineering. In the master there is a lot of interaction between students and staff. Students work on challenging assignments and get immediate feedback, stimulating rework, making the program very intensive.",2014-2015

Software Testing,"Course catalogue number 5364SOTE6Y Credits 6 EC Language of instruction English Time period(s)  See also College/graduate Graduate School of Informatics Lecturer(s) Is part of After the course, the student is able to understand and produce formal specifications of modest-sized samples of software, and is able to use formal specifications to generate relevant tests for the software. Software testing is checking whether a given software system satisfies given requirements or specifications. Without a specification, it is impossible to state what a piece of software should do, and there is no reasonable way to set up the test process. An informal specification is not enough, for if we want to automate the test process we need pre-given information about (i) which tests are relevant, and about (ii) what the outcomes of the relevant tests should be. The information about (i) states the preconditions of the code, and the information about (ii) states the postconditions. Programs written in functional or imperative languages can be tested, given a formal specification, by means of a random test generator. This test method will be illustrated for a number of example programs written in Haskell. The course includes a lightning introduction to this languages, and then focusses on how to test programs written in either functional or imperative style, and how to use tools for automated test generation.

Requirements Engineering,"Course catalogue number 5364REEN6Y Credits 6 EC Language of instruction English Time period(s)  College/graduate Graduate School of Informatics Lecturer(s) Is part of The success of a software system depends on the proper interpretation and analysis of user needs. Experience shows that it is extremely difficult to adequately define and specify a system. The perception of customers and users on the problem is often incomplete, inaccurate and changes over time. Knowledge is hard to express and to transfer. During this course you will understand why user needs are so hard to express, capture and understand. You will also learn the shortcomings of best practices like scrum, prototyping, interviewing and use cases. Furthermore you will learn about data-driven methods for requirements engineering like Contextual Design. Requirements methods and techniques will be discussed during the lectures. If feasible the whole student group will collaborate in one real life requirements project based on the method of contextual design. Next to specific RE literature we will also study literature from psychology, law, philosophy and cognitive science to get a better understanding of the subject. Finally students will design and do an experiment to show the inherent weakness of requirements best practices, like the use of prototyping for requirement validation.

Software Process,"Course catalogue number 5364SOPR6Y Credits 6 EC Language of instruction English Time period(s)  College/graduate Graduate School of Informatics Lecturer(s) Is part of During this course you will come to understand why big software engineering projects are prone to failure. You will come to understand how performance is influenced at different levels: that of the individual software engineer, the team and the whole organization. You will learn about motivation, competences, and the crucial role of culture. Also you will learn about organizational paradigms and control mechanisms, quality paradigms, and the role of planning and design in a world that is volatile and of which a lot is unknown. As software engineering is a special kind of organization, you will also learn how effective our best practices are. With this knowledge you will be able to understand why a method like RUP or Scrum is sometimes successful and sometimes not. You will also come to assess such a method and better be able to use it in such a way to improve overall project performance. Developing large scale software systems is challenging for many reasons. We work from a set of requirements that are ambiguous and incomplete, may be invalid and are subject to change. It’s hard to determine the quality and doneness of (intermediate) deliverables like designs, plans and code. We have to coordinate up to 1.000 software engineers with imperfect mechanisms for separation of concerns. To be able to understand reasons for software project failure we study failed projects. We learn about organizational control mechanisms and look at theory from social sciences notably motivation, empowerment, effective teams and coordination strategies. Last but not least we look at what we can learn from the quality community: Lean, CMMi, TQM, Kaizen. We will also examine evidence about the practices we apply in software engineering, like test first, pair programming, software architecture.

Software Evolution,"Course catalogue number 5364SOEV6Y Credits 6 EC Language of instruction English Time period(s)  See also College/graduate Graduate School of Informatics Lecturer(s) Is part of Our objectives are three-fold. The first objective is to acquire an understanding and appreciation of the challenges posed by software maintenance and software evolution. The second objective is to learn about quality of architecture and source code and how it affects software maintenance and evolution. The final objective is to be able to select and also construct software analysis and software transformation tools to help obtain insight in software quality and to help improve software quality. The course ties in closely with paper writing sessions where the objectives are to learn from academic literature, to develop curiosity, and to improve argumentation and writing skills. This course is designed around lab sessions in which we study real and large (open-source) software systems, written in languages like C, Java, PHP or Ruby. We use Rascal -a programming language workbench, or meta programming language- to apply and build software metrics, software analyses, software visualisations and (if time permits) software transformations. See http://www.rascal-mpl.org. The student is supported with introductory courses and interactive lab sessions while learning this new language in the beginning. The course is supported by a series of lectures on the theory of software maintenance and evolution, and a guided study of a number of research papers about maintenance, reverse engineering, reengineering and renovation. Example topics are clone detection, mining software repositories and refactoring. During the course students all write a short, but in-depth, paper about one of these subjects (possibly supported by facts generated by the lab exercises). Advanced programming skills in several programming languages.Basic knowledge of compiler construction (parsing, ASTs, basic code analysis, etc.)Good (academic) English reading and writing skills Registration is required viahttps://www.sis.uva.nluntil four weeks before the start of the semester. The format is focused on practical skills via the lab exercises, such as exploring source code and building tools, and academic skills via the paper writing component. Every week we start with two hour lecture on the theory of software evolution, which is required to understand the material covered in the lab exercises. The rest of the day and the following day are lab hours. You also need two hours time every other week to prepare for the bi-weekly two-hour paper sessions. - http://www.rascal-mpl.org- reader consisting of material on software evolution- potentially other (academic) sources This course typically uses various types of assessment, that will be detailed at the start of the course:- lab assignments, assessed by demonstration and oral exam- online test to assess basic skills- paper/essay- exam In this course we use the experimental programming language Rascal, which is (beta) open-source software and new to most students. On top of that we dive into many new topics for the students. Therefore the lab time is designed to be an integral and interactive part of the teaching, where the lecturer and the students are both present.

Content,"The Master Software Engineering has as goal to familiarize students with the broad and dynamic field of software engineering. Software engineering projects are complex and there is no recipe that guarantees success. This one year master makes students better engineers and designers, enabling them to make a significant contribution to large software projects and research projects addressing big software engineering questions. Software engineering uses many results from computer science but distinguishes itself from classical computer science curricula with respect to the role of human factors, system size and volatility of requirements. These factors cause a high degree of uncertainty about the impact and validity of design decisions. What is good for performance can be detrimental for understand ability. As software engineers and researchers we strive to understand these trade offs and reduce dependencies. As change and conflicting stakes are omnipresent, software continuously needs to evolve. The software engineering domain in itself is in constant flux. Innovations in technology, design patterns and techniques are continuous. However, out-of-the-box solutions often have their specific limitations. We believe a good software engineer is like a good researcher. We intend to teach our students how to acquire relevant knowledge, how to improve making decisions, how to reflect on their current approach, how to learn to question their assumptions and how to assess their ideas. We expect students to have a solid technological basis and a fundamental understanding of computer science and software. From a technical perspective the curriculum covers software quality, specification-based automated testing, automatic code analysis, automatic code transformation and development of domain specific languages. Non-technical topics focus on how to develop a software architecture, on understanding issues in requirements engineering and on organizational aspects of software engineering. In the master there is a lot of interaction between students and staff. Students work on challenging assignments and get immediate feedback, stimulating rework, making the program very intensive.",2015-2016

Software Testing,"Course catalogue number 5364SOTE6Y Credits 6 EC Language of instruction English Time period(s)  See also College/graduate Graduate School of Informatics Lecturer(s) Is part of After the course, the student is able to understand and produce formal specifications of modest-sized samples of software, and is able to use formal specifications to generate relevant tests for the software. Software testing is checking whether a given software system satisfies given requirements or specifications. Without a specification, it is impossible to state what a piece of software should do, and there is no reasonable way to set up the test process. An informal specification is not enough, for if we want to automate the test process we need pre-given information about (i) which tests are relevant, and about (ii) what the outcomes of the relevant tests should be. The information about (i) states the preconditions of the code, and the information about (ii) states the postconditions. Programs written in functional or imperative languages can be tested, given a formal specification, by means of a random test generator. This test method will be illustrated for a number of example programs written in Haskell. The course includes a lightning introduction to this languages, and then focusses on how to test programs written in either functional or imperative style, and how to use tools for automated test generation.

You will come to understand how performance is influenced at different levels: that of the individual software engineer, the team and the whole organization. You will learn about motivation, competences, and the crucial role of culture. Also you will learn about organizational paradigms and control mechanisms, quality paradigms, and the role of planning and design in a world that is volatile and of which a lot is unknown. As software engineering is a special kind of organization, you will also learn how effective our best practices are. With this knowledge you will be able to understand why a method like RUP or Scrum is sometimes successful and sometimes not. You will also come to assess such a method and better be able to use it in such a way to improve overall project performance. Developing large scale software systems is challenging for many reasons. We work from a set of requirements that are ambiguous and incomplete, may be invalid and are subject to change. It’s hard to determine the quality and doneness of (intermediate) deliverables like designs, plans and code. We have to coordinate up to 1.000 software engineers with imperfect mechanisms for separation of concerns. To be able to understand reasons for software project failure we study failed projects. We learn about organizational control mechanisms and look at theory from social sciences notably motivation, empowerment, effective teams and coordination strategies. Last but not least we look at what we can learn from the quality community: Lean, CMMi, TQM, Kaizen. We will also examine evidence about the practices we apply in software engineering, like test first, pair programming, software architecture.

This primarily covers the programming and implementation activities of a software engineering project. Examples of such activities are coding and debugging, detailed design, unit testing, code reviews, optimization, component integration and code generation. The course has two main objectivea: In the practical course students will implement a Domain-Specific Language (DSL). This involves both language engineering aspects (parsing, type checking, interpretation etc.) as well as a substantial amount of programming and discussion. The code will be reviewed based on aspects of code quality, simplicity, readability, modularity, separation of concerns and consistency of style. Lectures will provide the required background on DSLs, model-driven engineering (MDE), compiler theory, generative programming, code quality, ""Don't-Repeat-Yourself"" (DRY), code smells and design patterns. Additional academic literature covers subjects such as design-by-contract, SOLID principles, data abstraction, modularity, hierarchy, programming style, code smells, and object-oriented frameworks. Students are required to complete an exam based on the academic literature, to show they master concepts and practices relevant for high quality software construction.

This course is designed around lab sessions in which we study real and large (open-source) software systems, written in languages like C, Java, PHP or Ruby. We use Rascal -a programming language workbench, or meta programming language- to apply and build software metrics, software analyses, software visualisations and (if time permits) software transformations. See http://www.rascal-mpl.org. The student is supported with introductory courses and interactive lab sessions while learning this new language in the beginning. The course is supported by a series of lectures on the theory of software maintenance and evolution, guest lecturers from field experts, and a guided study of a number of research papers about maintenance, reverse engineering, reengineering and renovation. Example topics are clone detection, mining software repositories and refactoring. The format is focused on practical skills via the lab exercises, such as exploring source code and building tools, and academic skills via the paper sessions. Every week we start with a two hour lecture on the theory of software evolution, which is required to understand the material covered in the lab exercises. The rest of the day and the following day are lab hours. You also need two hours time every other week to prepare for the bi-weekly two-hour paper sessions. In this course we use the experimental programming language Rascal, which is (beta) open-source software and new to most students. On top of that we dive into many new topics for the students. Therefore the lab time is designed to be an integral and interactive part of the teaching, where the lecturer and the students are both present.

Content,"The Master Software Engineering familiarises students with the broad and dynamic field of software engineering. Software engineering projects are complex undertakings, and there is no one recipe that guarantees success in all cases. This one year master programme makes students better software engineers, designers and architects. It enables graduates to make significant contributions to large-scale software projects in industry and academia alike. Software engineering uses many results from computer science, but the Master Software Engineering distinguishes itself from classical computer science curricula in a number of aspects, among others the size and complexity of software systems concerned, the role of human factors and the volatility of requirements. These aspects lead to a high degree of uncertainty about the impact and validity of design decisions. What is good for performance may be detrimental for understandability, maintainability and re-use. Software engineers must strive to understand these trade-offs and reduce dependencies. As changing and conflicting goals are omnipresent, software continuously needs to evolve. The software engineering domain in itself is in constant flux. Innovations in technology, design patterns and techniques are continuous. However, out-of-the-box solutions often have their specific limitations. We believe a good software engineer is like a good researcher. We intend to teach our students how to acquire relevant knowledge, how to improve making decisions, how to reflect on their current approach, how to learn to question their assumptions and how to assess their ideas. We expect students to have a solid technological basis and a fundamental understanding of computer science and software. From a technical perspective the curriculum covers software quality, specification-based automated testing, automatic code analysis, automatic code transformation and development of domain specific languages. Non-technical topics focus on software architectures, on requirements engineering and on organizational aspects of software engineering. Continuous interaction between students and staff is characteristic for the programme. Students work on challenging assignments and receive immediate feedback, making the programme very intensive.",2016-2017

Requirements Engineering,"Course catalogue number 5364REEN6Y Credits 6 EC Language of instruction English Time period(s)  See also College/graduate Graduate School of Informatics Lecturer(s) Is part of The success of a software system depends on the proper interpretation and analysis of user needs. Experience shows that it is extremely difficult to adequately define and specify a system. The perception of customers and users of the problem is often incomplete, inaccurate and changes over time. Knowledge is hard to express and to transfer. During this course you will understand why user needs are so hard to express, capture and understand. You will also learn the shortcomings of best practices like scrum, prototyping, interviewing and use cases. Furthermore you will learn about data-driven methods for requirements engineering like Contextual Design. Requirements methods and techniques will be discussed during the lectures. If feasible the whole student group will collaborate in one real life requirements project based on the method of contextual design. Next to specific RE literature we will also study literature from psychology, law, philosophy and cognitive science to get a better understanding of the subject. Finally students will design and do an experiment to show the inherent weakness of requirements best practices, like the use of prototyping for requirement validation. This will be done from the perspective of human factors. Information about procedures can be found athttp://www.student.uva.nl/se/az/item/course-registration.html. Lecture, seminar and computer lab.

Software Testing,"Course catalogue number 5364SOTE6Y Credits 6 EC Language of instruction English Time period(s)  See also College/graduate Graduate School of Informatics Lecturer(s) Is part of After the course, the student is able to understand and produce formal specifications of modest-sized samples of software, and is able to use formal specifications to generate relevant tests for the software. Software testing is checking whether a given software system satisfies given requirements or specifications. Without a specification, it is impossible to state what a piece of software should do, and there is no reasonable way to set up the test process. An informal specification is not enough, for if we want to automate the test process we need pre-given information about (i) which tests are relevant, and about (ii) what the outcomes of the relevant tests should be. The information about (i) states the preconditions of the code, and the information about (ii) states the postconditions. Programs written in functional or imperative languages can be tested, given a formal specification, by means of a random test generator. This test method will be illustrated for a number of example programs written in Haskell. The course includes a lightning introduction to this languages, and then focusses on how to test programs written in either functional or imperative style, and how to use tools for automated test generation.

Software Process,"Course catalogue number 5364SOPR6Y Credits 6 EC Language of instruction English Time period(s)  See also College/graduate Graduate School of Informatics Lecturer(s) Is part of During this course you will come to understand why big software engineering projects are prone to failure. You will come to understand how performance is influenced at different levels: that of the individual software engineer, the team and the whole organization. You will learn about motivation, competences, and the crucial role of culture. Also you will learn about organizational paradigms and control mechanisms, quality paradigms, and the role of planning and design in a world that is volatile and of which a lot is unknown. As software engineering is a special kind of organization, you will also learn how effective our best practices are. With this knowledge you will be able to understand why a method like RUP or Scrum is sometimes successful and sometimes not. You will also come to assess such a method and better be able to use it in such a way to improve overall project performance. Developing large scale software systems is challenging for many reasons. We work from a set of requirements that are ambiguous and incomplete, may be invalid and are subject to change. It’s hard to determine the quality and doneness of (intermediate) deliverables like designs, plans and code. We have to coordinate up to 1.000 software engineers with imperfect mechanisms for separation of concerns. To be able to understand reasons for software project failure we study failed projects. We learn about organizational control mechanisms and look at theory from social sciences notably motivation, empowerment, effective teams and coordination strategies.

Content,"The Master Software Engineering familiarises students with the broad and dynamic field of software engineering. Software engineering projects are complex undertakings, and there is no one recipe that guarantees success in all cases. This one year master programme makes students better software engineers, designers and architects. It enables graduates to make significant contributions to large-scale software projects in industry and academia alike. Software engineering uses many results from computer science, but the Master Software Engineering distinguishes itself from classical computer science curricula in a number of aspects, among others the size and complexity of software systems concerned, the role of human factors and the volatility of requirements. These aspects lead to a high degree of uncertainty about the impact and validity of design decisions. What is good for performance may be detrimental for understandability, maintainability and re-use. Software engineers must strive to understand these trade-offs and reduce dependencies. As changing and conflicting goals are omnipresent, software continuously needs to evolve. The software engineering domain in itself is in constant flux. Innovations in technology, design patterns and techniques are continuous. However, out-of-the-box solutions often have their specific limitations. We believe a good software engineer is like a good researcher. We intend to teach our students how to acquire relevant knowledge, how to improve making decisions, how to reflect on their current approach, how to learn to question their assumptions and how to assess their ideas. We expect students to have a solid technological basis and a fundamental understanding of computer science and software. From a technical perspective the curriculum covers software quality, specification-based automated testing, automatic code analysis, automatic code transformation and development of domain specific languages. Non-technical topics focus on software architectures, on requirements engineering and on organizational aspects of software engineering. Continuous interaction between students and staff is characteristic for the programme. Students work on challenging assignments and receive immediate feedback, making the programme very intensive.",2017-2018

Experience shows that it is extremely difficult to adequately define and specify a system. The perception of stakeholders and users of the problem is often incomplete, inaccurate and changes over time. Knowledge is hard to express and to transfer. During this course you will understand why stakeholder needs are so hard to express, capture and understand. You will also learn the shortcomings of best practices like scrum, prototyping, interviewing and use cases. Furthermore you will learn about data-driven methods for requirements engineering like Contextual Design. Requirements methods and techniques will be discussed during the lectures. If possible, you will do a real life requirements project. Next to specific RE literature we will also study literature from law, philosophy and cognitive science to get a better understanding of the subject. Finally students will design and do an experiment to show the inherent weakness of requirements best practices, like the use of prototyping for requirement validation.

Software testing is checking whether a given software system satisfies given requirements or specifications. Without a specification, it is impossible to state what a piece of software should do, and there is no reasonable way to set up the test process. An informal specification is not enough, for if we want to automate the test process we need pre-given information about (i) which tests are relevant, and about (ii) what the outcomes of the relevant tests should be. The information about (i) states the preconditions of the code, and the information about (ii) states the postconditions. Programs written in functional or imperative languages can be tested, given a formal specification, by means of a random test generator. This test method will be illustrated for a number of example programs written in Haskell. The course includes a lightning introduction to this languages, and then focusses on how to test programs written in either functional or imperative style, and how to use tools for automated test generation. Basic familiarity with functional programming in Haskell. Information about procedures can be found athttp://www.student.uva.nl/se/az/item/course-registration.html.

This course is designed around lab sessions in which we study real and large (open-source) software systems, written in languages like C, Java, PHP or Ruby. We use Rascal -a programming language workbench, or meta programming language- to apply and build software metrics, software analyses, software visualisations and (if time permits) software transformations. Seehttp://www.rascal-mpl.org.The student is supported with introductory courses and interactive lab sessions while learning this new language in the beginning. The course is supported by a series of lectures on the theory of software maintenance and evolution, guest lecturers from field experts, and a guided study of a number of research papers about maintenance, reverse engineering, reengineering and renovation. Example topics are clone detection, mining software repositories and refactoring. Information about procedures can be found athttp://www.student.uva.nl/se/az/item/course-registration.html. The format is focused on practical skills via the lab exercises, such as exploring source code and building tools, and academic skills via the paper sessions. Every week we start with a two hour lecture on the theory of software evolution, which is required to understand the material covered in the lab exercises. The rest of the day and the following day are lab hours. You also need two hours time every other week to prepare for the bi-weekly two-hour paper sessions. In this course we use the experimental programming language Rascal, which is (beta) open-source software and new to most students. On top of that we dive into many new topics for the students. Therefore the lab time is designed to be an integral and interactive part of the teaching, where the lecturer and the students are both present. The schedule for this course is published onDataNose.

You will come to understand how performance is influenced at different levels: that of the individual software engineer, the team and the whole organization. You will learn about motivation, competences, and the crucial role of culture. Also you will learn about organizational paradigms and control mechanisms, quality paradigms, and the role of planning and design in a world that is volatile and of which a lot is unknown. As software engineering is a special kind of organization, you will also learn how effective our best practices are. With this knowledge you will be able to understand why a method like RUP or Scrum is sometimes successful and sometimes not. You will also come to assess such a method and better be able to use it in a situational fit way to improve overall project performance. Developing large scale software systems is challenging for many reasons. We work from a set of requirements that are ambiguous and incomplete, may be invalid and are subject to change. It’s hard to determine the quality and doneness of (intermediate) deliverables like designs, plans and code. We have to coordinate up to 1.000 software engineers with imperfect mechanisms for separation of concerns. To be able to understand reasons for software project failure we study failed projects. We learn about organizational control mechanisms and look at theory from social sciences notably motivation, empowerment, effective teams and coordination strategies. Last but not least we look at what we can learn from the quality community: Lean, CMMi, TQM, Kaizen. We will also examine evidence about the practices we apply in software engineering, like test first, pair programming, software architecture.

Programme,"The Master Software Engineering is a one-year academic programme with a mandatory curriculum of 60 EC. It familiarises students with the broad and dynamic field of software engineering. Software engineering projects are complex undertakings, and there is no one recipe that guarantees success in all cases. This one year master programme makes students better software engineers, designers and architects. It enables graduates to make significant contributions to large-scale software projects in industry and academia alike. Software engineering uses many results from computer science, but the Master Software Engineering distinguishes itself from classical computer science curricula in a number of aspects, among others the size and complexity of software systems concerned, the role of human factors and the volatility of requirements. These aspects lead to a high degree of uncertainty about the impact and validity of design decisions. What is good for performance may be detrimental for understandability, maintainability and re-use. Software engineers must strive to understand these trade-offs and reduce dependencies. As changing and conflicting goals are omnipresent, software continuously needs to evolve. The software engineering domain in itself is in constant flux. Innovations in technology, design patterns and techniques are continuous. However, out-of-the-box solutions often have their specific limitations. We believe a good software engineer is like a good researcher. We intend to teach our students how to acquire relevant knowledge, how to improve making decisions, how to reflect on their current approach, how to learn to question their assumptions and how to assess their ideas. We expect students to have a solid technological basis and a fundamental understanding of computer science and software. From a technical perspective the curriculum covers software quality, specification-based automated testing, automatic code analysis, automatic code transformation and development of domain specific languages. Non-technical topics focus on software architectures, on requirements engineering and on organizational aspects of software engineering. Continuous interaction between students and staff is characteristic for the programme. Students work on challenging assignments and receive immediate feedback, making the programme very intensive.

Experience shows that it is extremely difficult to adequately define and specify a system. The perception of stakeholders and users of the problem is often incomplete, inaccurate and changes over time. Knowledge is hard to express and to transfer. During this course you will understand why stakeholder needs are so hard to express, capture and understand. You will also learn the shortcomings of best practices like scrum, prototyping, interviewing and use cases. Furthermore you will learn about data-driven methods for requirements engineering like Contextual Design. Requirements methods and techniques will be discussed during the lectures. If possible, you will do a real life requirements project. Next to specific RE literature we will also study literature from law, philosophy and cognitive science to get a better understanding of the subject. Finally students will design and do an experiment to show the inherent weakness of requirements best practices, like the use of prototyping for requirement validation.

Without a specification, it is impossible to state what a piece of software should do, and there is no reasonable way to set up the test process. An informal specification is not enough. If we aim to automate the test process we need pre-given information about: Programs written in functional or imperative languages can be tested, given a formal specification, by means of a random test generator. This test method will be illustrated for a number of example programs that are written in Haskell. The course assumes basic familiarity with this language and focusses on how to test programs written in either functional or imperative style, and how to use tools for automated test generation.

Examples include mobile phones, TV sets, consumer electronics, Internet-of-Things, but also airplanes, cars, and satellites. Designing such embedded systems differs fundamentally from traditional design methods for general-purpose computer software: Embedded systems are subject to specific requirements, especially in terms of efficiency (size, weight and power) and costs. At the same time, embedded systems are subject to increased reliability constraints. The go-to solution to resolve system errors for general-purpose computing, i.e., a complete system restart, is typically precluded in an embedded system. The system must always be available and must always reliably produce correct results. To further complicate matters, the correctness of most embedded systems is not just defined by the correct result of a computation, but by the correct result and the correct timing. Imagine an air-bag controller, which must inflate the air-bag in time before the driver’s head hits the steering wheel, or a flight control system, which must correct turbulences, before the airplane becomes instable. Concerning less critical cases, we have for instance media players where the playback is delayed or the quality is degraded. In this course, we will provide an introduction to the domain of embedded computer systems, and teach common design and development methods of embedded software and systems.

You will come to understand how performance is influenced at different levels: that of the individual software engineer, the team and the whole organization. You will learn about motivation, competences, and the crucial role of culture. Also you will learn about organizational paradigms and control mechanisms, quality paradigms, and the role of planning and design in a world that is volatile and of which a lot is unknown. As software engineering is a special kind of organization, you will also learn how effective our best practices are. With this knowledge you will be able to understand why a method like RUP or Scrum is sometimes successful and sometimes not. You will also come to assess such a method and better be able to use it in a situational fit way to improve overall project performance. Developing large scale software systems is challenging for many reasons. We work from a set of requirements that are ambiguous and incomplete, may be invalid and are subject to change. It’s hard to determine the quality and doneness of (intermediate) deliverables like designs, plans and code. We have to coordinate up to 1.000 software engineers with imperfect mechanisms for separation of concerns. To be able to understand reasons for software project failure we study failed projects. We learn about organizational control mechanisms and look at theory from social sciences notably motivation, empowerment, effective teams and coordination strategies. Last but not least we look at what we can learn from the quality community: Lean, CMMi, TQM, Kaizen. We will also examine evidence about the practices we apply in software engineering, like test first, pair programming, software architecture.

Programme,"Website:http://www.student.uva.nl/se Programme Director:dr. C.U. Grelck. Programme organisation:The programme takes one academic year (60 credits) to complete and awards a Master of Science degree in Software Engineering. We offer 1-year full-time and 2-year part-time options. Study load and credits:The University of Amsterdam (UvA) applies the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS). The general study load for students is 30 EC per semester. A full academic year of two semesters equals 60 EC. Each semester lasts 20 weeks with 3 periods: 2 periods of 8 weeks and a third period of 4 weeks. A student’s study load (both contact hours and hours spent studying and preparing for assignments) is measured in European Credits (EC). Under Dutch law 1 EC represents 28 hours of work and 60 EC represent one academic year of full-time study. This is equivalent to about 40 hours of work per week. Regular courses: Period 1:  Period 2:  Period 4:  Preparation Master Project: This special course throughout periods 1, 2 and 3 complements the regular courses in teaching general academic and research skills with a focus on software engineering skills and background literature. In period 3 students prepare a research proposal that sets the scene for their graduation projects. Master Project Software Engineering: The 18-EC graduation project spans periods 5 and 6. Here students demonstrate the skills they have obtained so far.

Without a specification, it is impossible to state what a piece of software should do, and there is no reasonable way to set up the test process. An informal specification is not enough. If we aim to automate the test process we need pre-given information about: Programs written in functional or imperative languages can be tested, given a formal specification, by means of a random test generator. This test method will be illustrated for a number of example programs that are written in Haskell.

Examples include mobile phones, TV sets, consumer electronics, Internet-of-Things, but also airplanes, cars, and satellites. Designing such embedded systems differs fundamentally from traditional design methods for general-purpose computer software: Embedded systems are subject to specific requirements, especially in terms of efficiency (size, weight and power) and costs. At the same time, embedded systems are subject to increased reliability constraints. The go-to solution to resolve system errors for general-purpose computing, i.e., a complete system restart, is typically precluded in an embedded system. The system must always be available and must always reliably produce correct results. To further complicate matters, the correctness of most embedded systems is not just defined by the correct result of a computation, but by the correct result and the correct timing. Imagine an air-bag controller, which must inflate the air-bag in time before the driver’s head hits the steering wheel, or a flight control system, which must correct turbulences, before the airplane becomes instable. Concerning less critical cases, we have for instance media players where the playback is delayed or the quality is degraded. In this course, we will provide an introduction to the domain of embedded computer systems, and teach common design and development methods of embedded software and systems.

Our understanding of what needs to be done is at best incomplete, at points invalid, and subject to change. It’s hard to determine the adequacy of requirements, plans, designs and increments. The biggest projects require collaboration of thousands of people, with imperfect mechanisms for division of work, coordination, assessment of quality and assessment of progress. The code that is produced restricts the solution space for what still needs to be developed, and at worst becomes too complex to add the features that we need.

It familiarises students with the broad and dynamic field of software engineering. Software engineering projects are complex undertakings, and there is no single recipe that guarantees success in all cases. This one year master's programme makes students better software engineers, designers and architects. It enables graduates to make significant contributions to large-scale software projects in industry and academia alike. Software engineering uses many results from computer science, but the Master programme Software Engineering distinguishes itself from classical computer science curricula in a number of aspects, among others the size and complexity of software systems concerned and the role of human factors in the software engineering process. Both aspects lead to a high degree of uncertainty about the impact and validity of design decisions. What is good for performance may be detrimental for understandability, maintainability and re-use. Software engineers must strive to understand these trade-offs and reduce dependencies. As changing and conflicting goals are omnipresent, software continuously needs to evolve. The software engineering domain in itself is in constant flux. Innovations in technology, design patterns and techniques are continuous. Out-of-the-box solutions often have their specific limitations. We believe a good software engineer is like a good researcher. We teach our students how to acquire relevant knowledge, how to improve making decisions, how to reflect on their current approaches and ideas and to continuously question their assumptions. We expect students to have a solid technological basis and a fundamental understanding of computer science and software. From a technical perspective the curriculum covers software quality, specification-based testing and verification, code analysis and transformation as well as code evolution according to software metrics. These cross-cutting issues are complemented with domain-specific software concerns from new and emerging domains, such as cloud-based software and cyber-physical systems. Non-technical topics focus on requirements engineering and on organizational aspects of the software engineering process. Continuous interaction between students and staff is characteristic for the programm. Students work on challenging assignments and receive immediate feedback.

We offer 1-year full-time and 2-year part-time options. Study load and credits:The University of Amsterdam (UvA) applies the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS). The general study load for students is 30 EC per semester. A full academic year of two semesters equals 60 EC. Each semester lasts 20 weeks with 3 periods: 2 periods of 8 weeks and a third period of 4 weeks. A student’s study load (both contact hours and hours spent studying and preparing for assignments) is measured in European Credits (EC). According to Dutch law 1 EC represents 28 hours of work and 60 EC represent one academic year of full-time study. This is equivalent to about 40 hours of work per week. Regular courses: Period 1: Period 2: Period 4: Preparation Master Project: This special course throughout periods 1, 2 and 3 complements the regular courses in teaching general academic and research skills with a focus on software engineering skills and background literature. In period 3 students prepare a research proposal that sets the scene for their graduation project. Master Project Software Engineering: The 18-EC graduation project spans periods 5 and 6. During this graduation project students demonstrate the skills they have obtained so far. Graduation projects can be done in industry, at other research institutions or embedded within research groups at the University of Amsterdam.

Without a specification, it is impossible to state what a piece of software should do, and there is no reasonable way to set up the test process. An informal specification is not enough. If we aim to automate the test process we need pre-given information about: Programs written in functional or imperative languages can be tested, given a formal specification, by means of a random test generator. This test method will be illustrated for a number of example programs that are written in Haskell. The course assumes basic familiarity with this language and focusses on how to test programs written in either functional or imperative style, and how to use tools for automated test generation. Basic familiarity with logic and functional programming in Haskell.

Examples include mobile phones, TV sets, consumer electronics, Internet-of-Things, but also airplanes, cars, and satellites. Designing such embedded systems differs fundamentally from traditional design methods for general-purpose computer software: Embedded systems are subject to specific requirements, especially in terms of efficiency (size, weight and power) and costs. At the same time, embedded systems are subject to increased reliability constraints. The go-to solution to resolve system errors for general-purpose computing, i.e., a complete system restart, is typically precluded in an embedded system. The system must always be available and must always reliably produce correct results. To further complicate matters, the correctness of most embedded systems is not just defined by the correct result of a computation, but also by the correct timing. Imagine an air-bag controller, which must inflate the air-bag in time before the driver’s head hits the steering wheel, or a flight control system, which must correct turbulence, before the airplane becomes unstable. Concerning less critical cases, we have for instance media players where the playback is delayed or the quality is degraded. In this course, we will provide an introduction to the broad domain of embedded computer systems, and teach common design and development methods of embedded software and systems.

Our understanding of what needs to be done is at best incomplete, at points invalid, and subject to change. It’s hard to determine the adequacy of requirements, plans, designs and increments. The biggest projects require collaboration of thousands of people, with imperfect mechanisms for division of work, coordination, assessment of quality and assessment of progress. The code that is produced restricts the solution space for what still needs to be developed, and at worst becomes too complex to add the features that we need.

It familiarises students with the broad and dynamic field of software engineering. Software engineering projects are complex undertakings, and there is no single recipe that guarantees success in all cases. This one year master's programme makes students better software engineers, designers and architects. It enables graduates to make significant contributions to large-scale software projects in industry and academia alike. Software engineering uses many results from computer science, but the Master programme Software Engineering distinguishes itself from classical computer science curricula in a number of aspects, among others the size and complexity of software systems concerned and the role of human factors in the software engineering process. Both aspects lead to a high degree of uncertainty about the impact and validity of design decisions. What is good for performance may be detrimental for understandability, maintainability and re-use. Software engineers must strive to understand these trade-offs and reduce dependencies. As changing and conflicting goals are omnipresent, software continuously needs to evolve. The software engineering domain in itself is in constant flux. Innovations in technology, design patterns and techniques are continuous. Out-of-the-box solutions often have their specific limitations. We believe a good software engineer is like a good researcher. We teach our students how to acquire relevant knowledge, how to improve making decisions, how to reflect on their current approaches and ideas and to continuously question their assumptions. We expect students to have a solid technological basis and a fundamental understanding of computer science and software. From a technical perspective the curriculum covers software quality, specification-based testing and verification, code analysis and transformation as well as code evolution according to software metrics. These cross-cutting issues are complemented with domain-specific software concerns from new and emerging domains, such as cloud-based software and cyber-physical systems. Non-technical topics focus on requirements engineering and on organizational aspects of the software engineering process. Continuous interaction between students and staff is characteristic for the programm. Students work on challenging assignments and receive immediate feedback.

We offer 1-year full-time and 2-year part-time options. Study load and credits:The University of Amsterdam (UvA) applies the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS). The general study load for students is 30 EC per semester. A full academic year of two semesters equals 60 EC. Each semester lasts 20 weeks with 3 periods: 2 periods of 8 weeks and a third period of 4 weeks. A student’s study load (both contact hours and hours spent studying and preparing for assignments) is measured in European Credits (EC). According to Dutch law 1 EC represents 28 hours of work and 60 EC represent one academic year of full-time study. This is equivalent to about 40 hours of work per week. Regular courses: Period 1: Period 2: Period 4: Preparation Master Project: This special course throughout periods 1, 2 and 3 complements the regular courses in teaching general academic and research skills with a focus on software engineering skills and background literature. In period 3 students prepare a research proposal that sets the scene for their graduation project. Master Project Software Engineering: The 18-EC graduation project spans periods 5 and 6. During this graduation project students demonstrate the skills they have obtained so far. Graduation projects can be done in industry, at other research institutions or embedded within research groups at the University of Amsterdam.

Examples include smart phones, televisions, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, but also complex cyber-physical systems like airplanes, cars, and satellites. Designing such embedded systems fundamentally differs from traditional design methods for general-purpose computer software. Embedded systems are subject to specific requirements, especially in terms of efficiency (size, weight and power) and costs. At the same time, embedded systems are subject to increased reliability constraints. The go-to solution to resolve system errors for general-purpose computing, i.e., a complete system restart, is typically precluded in an embedded system. The system must always be available and must always reliably produce correct results. To further complicate matters, the correctness of most embedded systems is not just defined by the correct result of a computation, but by the correct result and the correct timing. Imagine an air-bag controller, which must inflate the air-bag in time before the driver’s head hits the steering wheel, or a flight control system, which must correct turbulences, before the airplane becomes unstable. Concerning less critical cases, we have for instance media players where the playback is delayed or the quality is degraded.

Our understanding of what needs to be done is at best incomplete, at points invalid, and subject to change. It’s hard to determine the adequacy of requirements, plans, designs and increments. The biggest projects require collaboration of thousands of people, with imperfect mechanisms for division of work, coordination, assessment of quality and assessment of progress. The code that is produced restricts the solution space for what still needs to be developed, and at worst becomes too complex to add the features that we need.

It familiarises students with the broad and dynamic field of software engineering. Software engineering projects are complex undertakings, and there is no single recipe that guarantees success in all cases. This one year master's programme makes students better software engineers, designers and architects. It enables graduates to make significant contributions to large-scale software projects in industry and academia alike. Software engineering uses many results from computer science, but the Master programme Software Engineering distinguishes itself from classical computer science curricula in a number of aspects, among others the size and complexity of software systems concerned and the role of human factors in the software engineering process. Both aspects lead to a high degree of uncertainty about the impact and validity of design decisions. What is good for performance may be detrimental for understandability, maintainability and re-use. Software engineers must strive to understand these trade-offs and reduce dependencies. As changing and conflicting goals are omnipresent, software continuously needs to evolve. The software engineering domain in itself is in constant flux. Innovations in technology, design patterns and techniques are continuous. Out-of-the-box solutions often have their specific limitations. We believe a good software engineer is like a good researcher. We teach our students how to acquire relevant knowledge, how to improve making decisions, how to reflect on their current approaches and ideas and to continuously question their assumptions. We expect students to have a solid technological basis and a fundamental understanding of computer science and software. From a technical perspective the curriculum covers software quality, specification-based testing and verification, code analysis and transformation as well as code evolution according to software metrics. These cross-cutting issues are complemented with domain-specific software concerns from new and emerging domains, such as cloud-based software and cyber-physical systems. Non-technical topics focus on requirements engineering and on organizational aspects of the software engineering process. Continuous interaction between students and staff is characteristic for the programme. Students work on challenging assignments and receive immediate feedback.

We offer 1-year full-time and 2-year part-time options. Study load and credits:The University of Amsterdam (UvA) applies the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS). The general study load for students is 30 EC per semester. A full academic year of two semesters equals 60 EC. Each semester lasts 20 weeks with 3 periods: 2 periods of 8 weeks and a third period of 4 weeks. A student’s study load (both contact hours and hours spent studying and preparing for assignments) is measured in European Credits (EC). According to Dutch law 1 EC represents 28 hours of work and 60 EC represent one academic year of full-time study. This is equivalent to about 40 hours of work per week. Regular courses: Period 1: Period 2: Period 4: Preparation Master Project: This special course throughout periods 1, 2 and 3 complements the regular courses in teaching general academic and research skills with a focus on software engineering skills and background literature. In period 3 students prepare a research proposal that sets the scene for their graduation project. Master Project Software Engineering: The 18-EC graduation project spans periods 5 and 6. During this graduation project students demonstrate the skills they have obtained so far. Graduation projects can be done in industry, at other research institutions or embedded within research groups at the University of Amsterdam.

Model-based Design of Cyber-physical Systems,"Course catalogue number 5364MBDC6Y Credits 6 EC Language of instruction English Time period(s)  See also College/graduate Graduate School of Informatics Lecturer(s) Contact Education Desk FNWIScience Park 904B1020 5257100servicedesk-esc-science@uva.nl servicedesk-esc-science@uva.nl Is part of Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are systems that integrate computation, sensing, actuation, and networking to interact with and control the physical world. They are built for a particular purpose and exist in many application domains. Well-known examples of CPS from different domains include satellites, airplanes, cars, cleaning robots, smart grids, smart lighting, x-ray machines, printers, radars, and lithography machines. The design of CPS is a multi-disciplinary activity that combines different fields, such as embedded systems, software engineering, control theory, and mechatronics, and is fundamentally different from the design of general-purpose computer systems, such as a desktop computer. CPS are subject to different non-functional requirements, such as size, weight, energy consumption, reliability, security, and cost. Some cyber-physical systems, such as a car or an airplane, are furthermore safety critical, and must guarantee that a system failure cannot result in death or injury. Such a system must always be available and must reliably produce correct results. To further complicate matters, the correctness of most CPS is not just defined by the correct result of a computation, but by the correct result and the correct timing. For example, consider an air-bag controller in a car, which must inflate the air-bag in time before the driver’s head hits the steering wheel, or a flight control system, which must correct turbulence before the airplane becomes unstable. Trends show that CPS across application domains are getting more and more complex. The consequences of this increasing complexity are visible in daily practice in which industry struggles to efficiently develop correct and well-performing CPS. This course is an introduction to CPS and their design, with a focus on computing aspects (hardware and software). It teaches how the increasing complexity of CPS can be addressed by model-based design methodologies in which abstraction, provided by models used for specification, analysis, simulation, or synthesis, play an essential role in increasing system quality and reducing development time and overall system cost.

Our understanding of what needs to be done is at best incomplete, at points invalid, and subject to change. It’s hard to determine the adequacy of requirements, plans, designs and increments. The biggest projects require collaboration of thousands of people, with imperfect mechanisms for division of work, coordination, assessment of quality and assessment of progress. It proofs hard to be a truely learning organization and to adapt in the right way. The code that is produced restricts the solution space for what still needs to be developed, and at worst proofs an obstacle to add the features that are needed.

Software Engineering,"Educational institute Graduate School of Informatics Programme type Master's Credits 60 EC Duration 1 year Instruction language English Education form Full-time, Day-time class Contact Education Desk FNWI Science Park 904 020 5257100 TheMaster Software Engineeringis a one-year academic programme with a compulsory curriculum of 60 EC. It familiarises students with the broad and dynamic field of software engineering. Software engineering projects are complex undertakings, and there is no single recipe that guarantees success in all cases. This one year master's programme makes students better software engineers, designers and architects. It enables graduates to make significant contributions to large-scale software projects in industry and academia alike. Software engineering uses many results from computer science, but the Master programme Software Engineering distinguishes itself from classical computer science curricula in a number of aspects, among others the size and complexity of software systems concerned and the role of human factors in the software engineering process. Both aspects lead to a high degree of uncertainty about the impact and validity of design decisions. What is good for performance may be detrimental for understandability, maintainability and re-use. Software engineers must strive to understand these trade-offs and reduce dependencies. As changing and conflicting goals are omnipresent, software continuously needs to evolve. The software engineering domain in itself is in constant flux. Innovations in technology, design patterns and techniques are continuous. Out-of-the-box solutions often have their specific limitations. We believe a good software engineer is like a good researcher. We teach our students how to acquire relevant knowledge, how to improve making decisions, how to reflect on their current approaches and ideas and to continuously question their assumptions. We expect students to have a solid technological basis and a fundamental understanding of computer science and software. From a technical perspective the curriculum covers software quality, specification-based testing and verification, code analysis and transformation as well as code evolution according to software metrics. These cross-cutting issues are complemented with domain-specific software concerns from new and emerging domains, such as cloud-based software and cyber-physical systems. Non-technical topics focus on requirements engineering and on organizational aspects of the software engineering process. Continuous interaction between students and staff is characteristic for the programme. Students work on challenging assignments and receive immediate feedback.

(Mailis) Birsak MSc Programme organisation:The programme takes one academic year (60 credits) to complete and awards a Master of Science degree in Software Engineering. We offer 1-year full-time and 2-year part-time options. Study load and credits:The University of Amsterdam (UvA) applies the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS). The general study load for students is 30 EC per semester. A full academic year of two semesters equals 60 EC. Each semester lasts 20 weeks with 3 periods: 2 periods of 8 weeks and a third period of 4 weeks. A student’s study load (both contact hours and hours spent studying and preparing for assignments) is measured in European Credits (EC). According to Dutch law 1 EC represents 28 hours of work and 60 EC represent one academic year of full-time study. This is equivalent to about 40 hours of work per week. Regular courses: Period 1: Period 2: Period 4: Preparation Master Project: This special course throughout periods 1, 2 and 3 complements the regular courses in teaching general academic and research skills with a focus on software engineering skills and background literature. In period 3 students prepare a research proposal that sets the scene for their graduation project. Master Project Software Engineering: The 18-EC graduation project spans periods 5 and 6. During this graduation project students demonstrate the skills they have obtained so far. Graduation projects can be done in industry, at other research institutions or embedded within research groups at the University of Amsterdam. The graduation project leads to a written thesis to be orally defended in front of a committee.

Without a specification, it is impossible to state what a piece of software should do, and there is no reasonable way to set up the test process. An informal specification is not enough. If we aim to automate the test process we need pre-given information about: Programs written in functional or imperative languages can be tested, given a formal specification, by means of a random test generator. This test method will be illustrated for a number of example programs that are written in Haskell.

Model-based Design of Cyber-physical Systems,"Course catalogue number 5364MBDC6Y Credits 6 EC Language of instruction English Time period(s)  See also College/graduate Graduate School of Informatics Lecturer(s) Contact Education Desk FNWIScience Park 904B1020 5257100servicedesk-esc-science@uva.nl servicedesk-esc-science@uva.nl Is part of Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are systems that integrate computation, sensing, actuation, and networking to interact with and control the physical world. They are built for a particular purpose and exist in many application domains. Well-known examples of CPS from different domains include satellites, airplanes, cars, x-ray machines, printers, radars, and lithography machines. The design of CPS is a multi-disciplinary activity that combines different fields, such as embedded systems, software engineering, control theory, and mechatronics, and is fundamentally different from the design of general-purpose computer systems, such as a desktop computer. CPS are subject to different non-functional requirements, such as size, weight, energy consumption, reliability, security, and cost. Some cyber-physical systems, such as a car or an airplane, are furthermore safety critical, and must guarantee that a system failure cannot result in death or injury. Such a system must always be available and must reliably produce correct results. To further complicate matters, the correctness of most CPS is not just defined by the correct result of a computation, but by the correct result and the correct timing. For example, consider an air-bag controller in a car, which must inflate the air-bag in time before the driver’s head hits the steering wheel, or a flight control system, which must correct turbulence before the airplane becomes unstable. Trends show that CPS across application domains are getting more and more complex. The consequences of this increasing complexity are visible in daily practice in which industry struggles to efficiently develop correct and well-performing CPS. This course is an introduction to CPS and their design, with a focus on computing aspects (hardware and software). It teaches how the increasing complexity of CPS can be addressed by model-based design methodologies in which abstraction, provided by models used for specification, analysis, simulation, or synthesis, play an essential role in increasing system quality and reducing development time and overall system cost.

Our understanding of what needs to be done is at best incomplete, at points invalid, and subject to change. It’s hard to determine the adequacy of requirements, plans, designs and increments. The biggest projects require collaboration of thousands of people, with imperfect mechanisms for division of work, coordination, assessment of quality and assessment of progress. It proofs hard to be a truely learning organization and to adapt in the right way. Every design decision, every line of code restricts the solution space for what still needs to be developed, and at worst proofs to be an obstacle to add the features that are needed.

Software Engineering,"Educational institute Graduate School of Informatics Programme type Master's Credits 60 EC Duration 1 year Instruction language English Education form Full-time, Day-time class Contact Education Desk FNWI Science Park 904 020 5257100 TheMaster Software Engineeringis a one-year academic programme with a compulsory curriculum of 60 EC. It familiarises students with the broad and dynamic field of software engineering. Software engineering projects are complex undertakings, and there is no single recipe that guarantees success in all cases. This one year master's programme makes students better software engineers, designers and architects. It enables graduates to make significant contributions to large-scale software projects in industry and academia alike. Software engineering uses many results from computer science, but the Master programme Software Engineering distinguishes itself from classical computer science curricula in a number of aspects, among others the size and complexity of software systems concerned and the role of human factors in the software engineering process. Both aspects lead to a high degree of uncertainty about the impact and validity of design decisions. What is good for performance may be detrimental for understandability, maintainability and re-use. Software engineers must strive to understand these trade-offs and reduce dependencies. As changing and conflicting goals are omnipresent, software continuously needs to evolve. The software engineering domain in itself is in constant flux. Innovations in technology, design patterns and techniques are continuous. Out-of-the-box solutions often have their specific limitations. We believe a good software engineer is like a good researcher. We teach our students how to acquire relevant knowledge, how to improve making decisions, how to reflect on their current approaches and ideas and to continuously question their assumptions. We expect students to have a solid technological basis and a fundamental understanding of computer science and software. From a technical perspective the curriculum covers software quality, specification-based testing and verification, code analysis and transformation as well as code evolution according to software metrics. These cross-cutting issues are complemented with domain-specific software concerns from new and emerging domains, such as cloud-based software and cyber-physical systems. Non-technical topics focus on requirements engineering and on organizational aspects of the software engineering process. Continuous interaction between students and staff is characteristic for the programme. Students work on challenging assignments and receive immediate feedback.

(Charlotte) Gevaert MSc Programme organisation:The programme takes one academic year (60 credits) to complete and awards a Master of Science degree in Software Engineering. We offer 1-year full-time and 2-year part-time options. Study load and credits:The University of Amsterdam (UvA) applies the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS). The general study load for students is 30 EC per semester. A full academic year of two semesters equals 60 EC. Each semester lasts 20 weeks with 3 periods: 2 periods of 8 weeks and a third period of 4 weeks. A student’s study load (both contact hours and hours spent studying and preparing for assignments) is measured in European Credits (EC). According to Dutch law 1 EC represents 28 hours of work and 60 EC represent one academic year of full-time study. This is equivalent to about 40 hours of work per week. Regular courses: Period 1: Period 2: Period 4: Preparation Master Project: This special course runs throughout periods 1, 2 and 3 complements the regular courses in teaching general academic and research skills with a focus on software engineering skills and background literature. In period 3 students prepare a research proposal that sets the scene for their graduation project. Master Project Software Engineering: The 18-EC graduation project spans periods 5 and 6. During this graduation project students demonstrate the skills they have obtained so far. Graduation projects can be done in industry, at other research institutions or embedded within research groups at the University of Amsterdam. The graduation project leads to a written thesis to be orally defended in front of a committee.

Without a specification, it is impossible to state what a piece of software should do, and there is no reasonable way to set up the test process. An informal specification is not enough. If we aim to automate the test process we need pre-given information about: Programs written in functional or imperative languages can be tested, given a formal specification, by means of a random test generator. This test method will be illustrated for a number of example programs that are written in Haskell. The course assumes basic familiarity with this language and focusses on how to test programs written in either functional or imperative style, and how to use tools for automated test generation.

Model-based Design of Cyber-physical Systems,"Course catalogue number 5364MBDC6Y Credits 6 EC Language of instruction English Time period(s)  See also College/graduate Graduate School of Informatics Lecturer(s) Contact Education Desk FNWIScience Park 904B1020 5257100servicedesk-esc-science@uva.nl servicedesk-esc-science@uva.nl Is part of Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are systems that integrate computation, sensing, actuation, and networking to interact with and control the physical world. They are built for a particular purpose and exist in many application domains. Well-known examples of CPS from different domains include satellites, airplanes, cars, x-ray machines, printers, radars, and lithography machines. The design of CPS is a multi-disciplinary activity that combines different fields, such as embedded systems, software engineering, control theory, and mechatronics, and is fundamentally different from the design of general-purpose computer systems, such as a desktop computer. CPS are subject to different non-functional requirements, such as size, weight, energy consumption, reliability, security, and cost. Some cyber-physical systems, such as a car or an airplane, are furthermore safety critical, and must guarantee that a system failure cannot result in death or injury. Such a system must always be available and must reliably produce correct results. To further complicate matters, the correctness of most CPS is not just defined by the correct result of a computation, but by the correct result and the correct timing. For example, consider an air-bag controller in a car, which must inflate the air-bag in time before the driver’s head hits the steering wheel, or a flight control system, which must correct turbulence before the airplane becomes unstable. Trends show that CPS across application domains are getting more and more complex. The consequences of this increasing complexity are visible in daily practice in which industry struggles to efficiently develop correct and well-performing CPS. This course is an introduction to CPS and their design, with a focus on computing aspects (hardware and software). It teaches how the increasing complexity of CPS can be addressed by model-based design methodologies in which abstraction, provided by models used for specification, analysis, simulation, or synthesis, play an essential role in increasing system quality and reducing development time and overall system cost.

Our understanding of what needs to be done is at best incomplete, at points invalid, and subject to change. It’s hard to determine the adequacy of plans and code. The biggest projects require collaboration of thousands of people, yet our mechanisms for division of work, coordination, and keeping track of progress have severe limitations. Learning is the credo, but in reality it proofs hard to adapt. Everything we do has impact, and not before long we work within the constraints of our own legacy. During this course you will read a lot about the many aspects of organizing software engineering. There will be guest lecturers to share their experiences with you. You will analyze a failed case and come up with a game plan for a project. Knowledge of software methods like Rup, Scrum, Xp and software practices like pair programming, test first.
