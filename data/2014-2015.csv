Content,"The Master Software Engineering has as goal to familiarize students with the broad and dynamic field of software engineering. Software engineering projects are complex and there is no recipe that guarantees success. This one year master makes students better engineers and designers, enabling them to make a significant contribution to large software projects and research projects addressing big software engineering questions. Software engineering uses many results from computer science but distinguishes itself from classical computer science curricula with respect to the role of human factors, system size and volatility of requirements. These factors cause a high degree of uncertainty about the impact and validity of design decisions. What is good for performance can be detrimental for understand ability. As software engineers and researchers we strive to understand these trade offs and reduce dependencies. As change and conflicting stakes are omnipresent, software continuously needs to evolve. The software engineering domain in itself is in constant flux. Innovations in technology, design patterns and techniques are continuous. However, out-of-the-box solutions often have their specific limitations. We believe a good software engineer is like a good researcher. We intend to teach our students how to acquire relevant knowledge, how to improve making decisions, how to reflect on their current approach, how to learn to question their assumptions and how to assess their ideas. We expect students to have a solid technological basis and a fundamental understanding of computer science and software. From a technical perspective the curriculum covers software quality, specification-based automated testing, automatic code analysis, automatic code transformation and development of domain specific languages. Non-technical topics focus on how to develop a software architecture, on understanding issues in requirements engineering and on organizational aspects of software engineering. In the master there is a lot of interaction between students and staff. Students work on challenging assignments and get immediate feedback, stimulating rework, making the program very intensive."

Software Testing,"Course catalogue number 5364SOTE6Y Credits 6 EC Language of instruction English Time period(s)  See also College/graduate Graduate School of Informatics Lecturer(s) Is part of After the course, the student is able to understand and produce formal specifications of modest-sized samples of software, and is able to use formal specifications to generate relevant tests for the software. Software testing is checking whether a given software system satisfies given requirements or specifications. Without a specification, it is impossible to state what a piece of software should do, and there is no reasonable way to set up the test process. An informal specification is not enough, for if we want to automate the test process we need pre-given information about (i) which tests are relevant, and about (ii) what the outcomes of the relevant tests should be. The information about (i) states the preconditions of the code, and the information about (ii) states the postconditions. Programs written in functional or imperative languages can be tested, given a formal specification, by means of a random test generator. This test method will be illustrated for a number of example programs written in Haskell. The course includes a lightning introduction to this languages, and then focusses on how to test programs written in either functional or imperative style, and how to use tools for automated test generation.

Requirements Engineering,"Course catalogue number 5364REEN6Y Credits 6 EC Language of instruction English Time period(s)  College/graduate Graduate School of Informatics Lecturer(s) Is part of The success of a software system depends on the proper interpretation and analysis of user needs. Experience shows that it is extremely difficult to adequately define and specify a system. The perception of customers and users on the problem is often incomplete, inaccurate and changes over time. Knowledge is hard to express and to transfer. During this course you will understand why user needs are so hard to express, capture and understand. You will also learn the shortcomings of best practices like scrum, prototyping, interviewing and use cases. Furthermore you will learn about data-driven methods for requirements engineering like Contextual Design. Requirements methods and techniques will be discussed during the lectures. If feasible the whole student group will collaborate in one real life requirements project based on the method of contextual design. Next to specific RE literature we will also study literature from psychology, law, philosophy and cognitive science to get a better understanding of the subject. Finally students will design and do an experiment to show the inherent weakness of requirements best practices, like the use of prototyping for requirement validation.

Software Process,"Course catalogue number 5364SOPR6Y Credits 6 EC Language of instruction English Time period(s)  College/graduate Graduate School of Informatics Lecturer(s) Is part of During this course you will come to understand why big software engineering projects are prone to failure. You will come to understand how performance is influenced at different levels: that of the individual software engineer, the team and the whole organization. You will learn about motivation, competences, and the crucial role of culture. Also you will learn about organizational paradigms and control mechanisms, quality paradigms, and the role of planning and design in a world that is volatile and of which a lot is unknown. As software engineering is a special kind of organization, you will also learn how effective our best practices are. With this knowledge you will be able to understand why a method like RUP or Scrum is sometimes successful and sometimes not. You will also come to assess such a method and better be able to use it in such a way to improve overall project performance. Developing large scale software systems is challenging for many reasons. We work from a set of requirements that are ambiguous and incomplete, may be invalid and are subject to change. It’s hard to determine the quality and doneness of (intermediate) deliverables like designs, plans and code. We have to coordinate up to 1.000 software engineers with imperfect mechanisms for separation of concerns. To be able to understand reasons for software project failure we study failed projects. We learn about organizational control mechanisms and look at theory from social sciences notably motivation, empowerment, effective teams and coordination strategies. Last but not least we look at what we can learn from the quality community: Lean, CMMi, TQM, Kaizen. We will also examine evidence about the practices we apply in software engineering, like test first, pair programming, software architecture.

Software Evolution,"Course catalogue number 5364SOEV6Y Credits 6 EC Language of instruction English Time period(s)  See also College/graduate Graduate School of Informatics Lecturer(s) Is part of Our objectives are three-fold. The first objective is to acquire an understanding and appreciation of the challenges posed by software maintenance and software evolution. The second objective is to learn about quality of architecture and source code and how it affects software maintenance and evolution. The final objective is to be able to select and also construct software analysis and software transformation tools to help obtain insight in software quality and to help improve software quality. The course ties in closely with paper writing sessions where the objectives are to learn from academic literature, to develop curiosity, and to improve argumentation and writing skills. This course is designed around lab sessions in which we study real and large (open-source) software systems, written in languages like C, Java, PHP or Ruby. We use Rascal -a programming language workbench, or meta programming language- to apply and build software metrics, software analyses, software visualisations and (if time permits) software transformations. See http://www.rascal-mpl.org. The student is supported with introductory courses and interactive lab sessions while learning this new language in the beginning. The course is supported by a series of lectures on the theory of software maintenance and evolution, and a guided study of a number of research papers about maintenance, reverse engineering, reengineering and renovation. Example topics are clone detection, mining software repositories and refactoring. During the course students all write a short, but in-depth, paper about one of these subjects (possibly supported by facts generated by the lab exercises). Advanced programming skills in several programming languages.Basic knowledge of compiler construction (parsing, ASTs, basic code analysis, etc.)Good (academic) English reading and writing skills Registration is required viahttps://www.sis.uva.nluntil four weeks before the start of the semester. The format is focused on practical skills via the lab exercises, such as exploring source code and building tools, and academic skills via the paper writing component. Every week we start with two hour lecture on the theory of software evolution, which is required to understand the material covered in the lab exercises. The rest of the day and the following day are lab hours. You also need two hours time every other week to prepare for the bi-weekly two-hour paper sessions. - http://www.rascal-mpl.org- reader consisting of material on software evolution- potentially other (academic) sources This course typically uses various types of assessment, that will be detailed at the start of the course:- lab assignments, assessed by demonstration and oral exam- online test to assess basic skills- paper/essay- exam In this course we use the experimental programming language Rascal, which is (beta) open-source software and new to most students. On top of that we dive into many new topics for the students. Therefore the lab time is designed to be an integral and interactive part of the teaching, where the lecturer and the students are both present.
