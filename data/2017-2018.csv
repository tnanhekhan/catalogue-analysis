Content,"The Master Software Engineering familiarises students with the broad and dynamic field of software engineering. Software engineering projects are complex undertakings, and there is no one recipe that guarantees success in all cases. This one year master programme makes students better software engineers, designers and architects. It enables graduates to make significant contributions to large-scale software projects in industry and academia alike. Software engineering uses many results from computer science, but the Master Software Engineering distinguishes itself from classical computer science curricula in a number of aspects, among others the size and complexity of software systems concerned, the role of human factors and the volatility of requirements. These aspects lead to a high degree of uncertainty about the impact and validity of design decisions. What is good for performance may be detrimental for understandability, maintainability and re-use. Software engineers must strive to understand these trade-offs and reduce dependencies. As changing and conflicting goals are omnipresent, software continuously needs to evolve. The software engineering domain in itself is in constant flux. Innovations in technology, design patterns and techniques are continuous. However, out-of-the-box solutions often have their specific limitations. We believe a good software engineer is like a good researcher. We intend to teach our students how to acquire relevant knowledge, how to improve making decisions, how to reflect on their current approach, how to learn to question their assumptions and how to assess their ideas. We expect students to have a solid technological basis and a fundamental understanding of computer science and software. From a technical perspective the curriculum covers software quality, specification-based automated testing, automatic code analysis, automatic code transformation and development of domain specific languages. Non-technical topics focus on software architectures, on requirements engineering and on organizational aspects of software engineering. Continuous interaction between students and staff is characteristic for the programme. Students work on challenging assignments and receive immediate feedback, making the programme very intensive."

Experience shows that it is extremely difficult to adequately define and specify a system. The perception of stakeholders and users of the problem is often incomplete, inaccurate and changes over time. Knowledge is hard to express and to transfer. During this course you will understand why stakeholder needs are so hard to express, capture and understand. You will also learn the shortcomings of best practices like scrum, prototyping, interviewing and use cases. Furthermore you will learn about data-driven methods for requirements engineering like Contextual Design. Requirements methods and techniques will be discussed during the lectures. If possible, you will do a real life requirements project. Next to specific RE literature we will also study literature from law, philosophy and cognitive science to get a better understanding of the subject. Finally students will design and do an experiment to show the inherent weakness of requirements best practices, like the use of prototyping for requirement validation. Information about procedures can be found athttp://www.student.uva.nl/se/az/item/course-registration.html. The schedule for this course is published onDataNose. Reading tests, paper and lab work. Recommended prior knowledge: Knowledge of requirement engineering, for example books of Sommerville, Robertson, van Lamsweerde, Wiegers or Pohl.

Software testing is checking whether a given software system satisfies given requirements or specifications. Without a specification, it is impossible to state what a piece of software should do, and there is no reasonable way to set up the test process. An informal specification is not enough, for if we want to automate the test process we need pre-given information about (i) which tests are relevant, and about (ii) what the outcomes of the relevant tests should be. The information about (i) states the preconditions of the code, and the information about (ii) states the postconditions. Programs written in functional or imperative languages can be tested, given a formal specification, by means of a random test generator. This test method will be illustrated for a number of example programs written in Haskell. The course includes a lightning introduction to this languages, and then focusses on how to test programs written in either functional or imperative style, and how to use tools for automated test generation. Basic familiarity with functional programming in Haskell. Information about procedures can be found athttp://www.student.uva.nl/se/az/item/course-registration.html.

This course is designed around lab sessions in which we study real and large (open-source) software systems, written in languages like C, Java, PHP or Ruby. We use Rascal -a programming language workbench, or meta programming language- to apply and build software metrics, software analyses, software visualisations and (if time permits) software transformations. Seehttp://www.rascal-mpl.org.The student is supported with introductory courses and interactive lab sessions while learning this new language in the beginning. The course is supported by a series of lectures on the theory of software maintenance and evolution, guest lecturers from field experts, and a guided study of a number of research papers about maintenance, reverse engineering, reengineering and renovation. Example topics are clone detection, mining software repositories and refactoring. Information about procedures can be found athttp://www.student.uva.nl/se/az/item/course-registration.html. The format is focused on practical skills via the lab exercises, such as exploring source code and building tools, and academic skills via the paper sessions. Every week we start with a two hour lecture on the theory of software evolution, which is required to understand the material covered in the lab exercises. The rest of the day and the following day are lab hours. You also need two hours time every other week to prepare for the bi-weekly two-hour paper sessions. In this course we use the experimental programming language Rascal, which is (beta) open-source software and new to most students. On top of that we dive into many new topics for the students. Therefore the lab time is designed to be an integral and interactive part of the teaching, where the lecturer and the students are both present. The schedule for this course is published onDataNose.

You will come to understand how performance is influenced at different levels: that of the individual software engineer, the team and the whole organization. You will learn about motivation, competences, and the crucial role of culture. Also you will learn about organizational paradigms and control mechanisms, quality paradigms, and the role of planning and design in a world that is volatile and of which a lot is unknown. As software engineering is a special kind of organization, you will also learn how effective our best practices are. With this knowledge you will be able to understand why a method like RUP or Scrum is sometimes successful and sometimes not. You will also come to assess such a method and better be able to use it in a situational fit way to improve overall project performance. Developing large scale software systems is challenging for many reasons. We work from a set of requirements that are ambiguous and incomplete, may be invalid and are subject to change. It’s hard to determine the quality and doneness of (intermediate) deliverables like designs, plans and code. We have to coordinate up to 1.000 software engineers with imperfect mechanisms for separation of concerns. To be able to understand reasons for software project failure we study failed projects. We learn about organizational control mechanisms and look at theory from social sciences notably motivation, empowerment, effective teams and coordination strategies. Last but not least we look at what we can learn from the quality community: Lean, CMMi, TQM, Kaizen. We will also examine evidence about the practices we apply in software engineering, like test first, pair programming, software architecture. Knowledge of software methods like Rup, Scrum, Xp and software practices like pair programming, test first. Experience with working in big projects.

This primarily covers the programming and implementation activities of a software engineering project. Examples of such activities are coding and debugging, detailed design, unit testing, code reviews, optimization, component integration and code generation. The course has two main objectives: In the practical part of the course students will implement a Domain-Specific Language (DSL). This involves both language engineering aspects (parsing, type checking, interpretation etc.) as well as a substantial amount of programming and discussion. The code will be reviewed based on aspects of code quality, simplicity, readability, modularity, separation of concerns and consistency of style. Lectures will provide the required background on DSLs, model-driven engineering (MDE), compiler theory, generative programming, code quality, ""Don't-Repeat-Yourself"" (DRY), code smells and design patterns. Additional academic literature covers subjects such as design-by-contract, SOLID principles, data abstraction, modularity, hierarchy, programming style, code smells, and object-oriented frameworks. Students are required to complete an exam based on the academic literature, to show they master concepts and practices relevant for high quality software construction. Information about procedures can be found athttp://www.student.uva.nl/se/az/item/course-registration.html. The schedule for this course is published onDataNose. The assessment is based on the code produced during the labs and on a final written exam. Both must be passed individually; the final grade is the average of both the lab and the exam grade.
